## What does it contain?
- All beta releases of Discord RNA
- All alpha releases of Discord RNA

## Want to maintain your own snapshot?
If you want to maintain your own snapshot of Discord RNA builds, you can fork this repo to do so.<br>
I advise you to use the Windows Subsystem for Android with the SAI and Lucky Patcher apps on your PC to make the split APKs in the same format as I have here.<br>
Go crazy!

Thanks for using my snapshot!<br>
"RNA" stands for **React Native Android**.
